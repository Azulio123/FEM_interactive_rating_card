## Overview

Pretty tough beginner JS project for me. I am still not adept at coding!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size (mobile focus, please adjust browser to mobile size)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Jquery

### What I learned

I learned that you need a lot of help and time to learn how to properly code. My head still feels like it will explode every time I try and use javascript, but I hope to get better and create a cool project by the end of my Redi-School Aarhus semester!


### Continued development

I need to buckle down and do more projects. I want to build websites that work and look good!
